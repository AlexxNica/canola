## Drawing dots as strokes


As Sean Sans original drawing is a *Hairline* already I want to test the *Black Wide* from the other side of the [design space setup](http://metapolator.github.io/sean/). Taking Lasses Demo Project I duplicate inherited.cps from data/com.metapolator/cps folder into blackwide.cps and add it to the project setup (project.yaml)
